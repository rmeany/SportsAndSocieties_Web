# SportsAndSocieties_Web
This was the web app section of my final year project for CIT. It allows users to enter details in forms for different sections in the mobile application. The information entered in these forms gets stored in a cloud-hosted database (Firebase) and immediately updates the mobile app.
Javascript, HTML and CSS were used to develop the functionailty of the forms and communicate effectively with Firebase.

Details entered in the forms are as follows.

Sports Clubs

-Fixture...CIT Team, Opponent, Competition Type (league,cup,etc), Location, Date, Time

-Result...CIT Team, CIT Score, Opponent, Opponent Score, Competition Type (league,cup,etc), Location, Date, Time

-Event...Event Name, Location, Date, Time

Societies

-Event...Event Name, Location, Date, Time

All file names relating to admin are to do with the admin section of the web app. The admin section has Firebase Authentication. Admins can update and remove information directly from the mobile app through easily navigatable forms. Admins can also see how many people are interested in going to a particular event.
